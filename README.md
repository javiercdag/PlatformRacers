## About

This is an university project about a videogame using three.js library. We decided to create a 3D and first person platform game.

*three.js is not a game engine, so we had to create all the physics and mechanics, making it more challenging.*

## Libraries

This is the complete list of the libraries used in this project:

- MTLLoader.js
- PointerLockControls.js
- stats.module.js
- three.js
- Tween.js

## Source code

Feel free to check the complete code [here](src) and use it in your own projects :)

## Resources

We decided to use non-copyright resources for images, music and textures. You can check the complete list of resources used [here](resources).
